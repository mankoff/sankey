\begin{abstract}

  Observing, quantifying, and understanding mass loss takes field observations, computer models, and insight through knowledge generation and sharing. Tabular data is optimized for computers and useful for humans, but graphical presentations can provide significantly higher information density. Here we present several Sankey diagrams depicting mass flow of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, and discuss some properties of the graphics and the cryospheric processes represented by the graphics. We focus on insight available through this choice of display, methods for estimating the various cryospheric processes, and uncertainty,
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction and Background}

Mass flows of ice sheets, and subsequent mass gains and losses, is an of-studied topic in the domain of glaciology. However, few studies consider all processes and their relative magnitudes and uncertainties - this is usually the domain of review papers. Here we present a Sankey diagram that provides an overview of all mass flow terms and processes for both the Greenlandic and Antarctic ice sheets. We use this display to highlight a) relative magnitudes among processes within ice sheets and among ice sheets and sectors, and b) the uncertainty associated with each property. We also... TBD.

\subsection{Introduction to Sankey diagrams}

Sankey diagrams are graphical representations of flow or movement of any property (e.g., mass, energy, money, etc.). An early and famous use was Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812 (c.f., \citet{kraak_2021}) that combines the magnitude of active soldiers overlaid on a geographical map to show attrition during war. The method was later refined, popularized, and eventually named after Captain Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey who used it to show, among other things, the energy efficiency of a steam engine.

\section{Overview of mass flows}

See \url{https://github.com/mankoff/sankey/issues/16} for discussion of graphical plan. Comment there or here.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation of graphics}

Sankey diagrams are generally intuitive, but the following section may still be helpful in interpreting the diagrams. The widths of any section within any figure is proportional to all other widths. Widths are/are-not (TODO, see https://github.com/mankoff/sankey/issues/16) proportional between images. The flows can be somewhat tied to physical space or geography, but are not. An alternate display by \citet[Fig. 2]{cogley_2011} shows a similar diagram overlaid an a glacier schematic, but without flow magnitude nor proportionality.

Color here represents both phase and net mass change. Colors gray, blue, and white represent solid, liquid, and gaseous phases respectively, while red and black highlight net mass loss or gain. The latter may be counter-intuitive - for example to see mass loss as an input at the top (red in Fig. \ref{fig:gl}) even though most mass loss terms (runoff, calving, etc.) are at the bottom. This is because Sankey diagrams are balanced, outputs are larger than inputs (hence net mass loss), so the mass loss term is an input - drawdown of the historical 'stable' ice mass. Conversely, in East Antarctica mass gain is an output at the bottom (black in Fig. \ref{fig:aq}b} that balances the diagram, because without it, there are more flows into the system than out of it.

%% We mark grounding line in Antarctica and frontal retreat in Greenland in red, even if Antarctica has net mass gain, because not all mass is equal when considering ice sheet health. Antarctica is mass positive because of increased snowfalls. Grounding line retreat is a localized mass imbalance term.


See thick red outlines on frontal retreat and grounding line retreat. Can't be in steady state if these processes are active. Steady state may not be a natural occurrance. Could have these and be quasi-steady (cyclical).

\subsection{Missing terms and limitations}

See \citet[Fig. 2]{cogley_2011}

Basal freeze-on (e.g., \citet{bell_2014}) is not shown. It is currently unknown by Ken if this is refreezing of the basal melting term (e.g.,\citet{karlsson_2021}) and therefore that terms source remains unchanged, but some diverts back to the dynamics flow and the basal melting output is reduced, or if the basal melting term is final basal runoff, in which case the source should be increased by the refreezing amount. Nonetheless, we do not know the refreezing value.

Also:
\begin{itemize}
\item Avalanche on/off. Maybe matters more for glaciers than ice sheets?
\item Subaerial frontal melt/sublimation. That is, the vertical face in Greenland above the water line. This is included in other terms.
\item Snow drifting on/off. Not sure how much snow drifts onto an ice sheet, but snow drift off could be good to include.
\item Grounding line retreat in Greenland. Different than frontal retreat. Ignored, as there are few ice shelves.
\end{itemize}

There may be other missing terms. For example, an earlier version of this graphic by \citet[Fig. 2]{cogley_2011} did not contain frontal nor grounding line retreat. These are two distinct processes when ice shelves exist, but can be treated as synonyms for one process at tidewater glacier margins. These terms were not only not included in \citet{cogley_2011}, but their respective values were highly uncertain, and still are, although recent work by \citet{kochtitzky_2023,greene_2024} have constrained these values in Greenland. 

\section{Uncertainty}

Note that some uncertainty (e.g. snowfall) is larger than many other terms combined.

Advice from Hester: Synthesize what each of the uncertainties is a function of (lack of measurements/scale/timing of measurements/lack of process understanding/variability/etc.). Also, rather than singling the uncertainty of each factor the feedbacks between them could be indicated.

\subsection{Shelves}

Mass change of shelves is a bulk aggregate property, and should not the default reporting metric because it obscures information. For example, in theory ice shelf mass can grow even as they collapse, as long as the grounding line retreats (adds mass to the shelf from the upstream ice sheet) faster than the mass loss at the frontal or submarine boundaries. A mass flow diagram dedicated to ice shelves (this one is not) would clearly convey each of these processes. 

\subsection{Drifting snow}

% I think if you were to go into a discussion of snowdrift it should go further than, for example, the works of Lenaerts et al. Perhaps it is beter to plainly list the uncertainties / poor definitions but in terms of process just refer to the existing papers. However, I am in two minds about this.

\section{Methods}

Use published values. See CSV tables in \texttt{dat/} folder or README.org

Approximate where values are not easily accessed.

We do not have access to the basal mass balance for Antarctica in spatial map form, only a total Antarctic-wide value from \citet{pattyn_2010} reported at 65 Gt yr^{-1}. To estimate basal melt for East and West Antarctica, we scale by the magnitude of geothermal heat flux scaled by area for East, West, and Peninsula which is 70 \%, 25 \%, and 5 \% respectively, compared to scaling by area alone which has 75 \% of the area in East Antarctica.

%% \subsection{Figures}

%% Figures may be typeset in either one- or two-column format. One-column format allows up to 86$\,$mm (e.g. Fig.~\ref{tracks}); two-column format up to 178$\,$mm (e.g. Fig.~\ref{filters}). Please do not provide original graphics files in which the figure is a great deal larger or smaller than what you envisage will be the final printed size. To typeset two-column format, add asterisks (\verb"\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}") as shown in Fig.~\ref{filters}. We may change the format in-house if necessary. Please note that if you choose to refer to figures using labels, \verb"\caption" must precede \verb"\label", as in standard \LaTeX. 

%% Please send one file for each figure (in other words do not use subfigures) and use a name that clearly identifies it (e.g. `72A712Fig03.eps').

%% In addition, figures should be eps, ai (illustrator), ps, tif, psd or pdf. Use strong black lines with a width of at least 0.75pt at final printed size (avoid tinting if possible) and SI units in labels. Lettering should ideally be Optima to match the final typeface; Arial or a similar sans serif font for a second choice. Aim to have the final-size lettering at 9pt, if possible. Figures should not be in boxes. The source code for Figs~\ref{tracks} and~\ref{filters} is shown immediately below the figures.

%% \subsection{Equations}

%% We are including some complex equations as examples. Equations should be checked for width by removing the \verb"[review]" option. Note the use of \verb|cases*| in the following equation:
%% \begin{equation}
%% \label{arrayexample}
%% \alpha_{t_2}= %
%%   \begin{cases}
%%     \alpha_{t_1} - a_1 [\ln (T+1)]
%%       \mathrm{e}^{(a_2\sqrt{n})}
%%       & \mbox{$n_\mathrm{d} > 0\enskip$ and
%%       $\enskip T > 0$}\\
%%     \alpha_{t_1} - a_3 \mathrm{e}^{(a_2\sqrt{n})}
%%       & \mbox{$n_\mathrm{d} > 0\enskip$ and
%%       $\enskip T < 0$}\\
%%     \alpha_{t_1} + a_4 P_\mathrm{s}
%%       & \mbox{$n_\mathrm{d} = 0$}
%%   \end{cases}
%% \end{equation}

%% Equations should be aligned on the equals signs where possible. Equations that extend beyond the one-column measure should be turned over before an operator. 

%% \begin{equation}
%% \label{eqnarrayexample}
%% \begin{aligned}
%% l_c & =  l_0 \left(\frac{\widebar{R}_m}{R} \right)^2
%%   \psi^{\frac{P}{P_0\cos Z}}\\
%%     & \phantom{=} \quad  \times [\cos\beta\, \cos Z
%%     + \sin\beta\,\sin Z\,\cos(\psi_\mathrm{sun}
%%     - \psi_\mathrm{slope})]
%% \end{aligned}
